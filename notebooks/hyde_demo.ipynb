Moreover, a substantial proportion of cases are genetically mediated, with \\nimplications for family counselling and presymptomatic diagnosis.

Among these, the shift towards remote working arrangements is still present in our workplaces, impacting employees’ well-being and productivity. This systematic review aims to describe the pandemic’s consequences on work organization by analyzing whether and how the shift towards remote or home-working impacted employees’ productivity, performance, and well-being. Furthermore, it describes the role of individual and organizational factors in determining employees’ adjustment to remote work. Sixty-seven peer-reviewed papers published from 2020 to 2022, written in English, were selected through the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Findings describe how remote working arrangements, the workplace and organizational factors, and the employees’ individual traits and skills impacted employees’ productivity and well-being. Furthermore, they provide a description of the organizational enforcement actions reported in the literature. Managerial and practical implications, such as enforcement actions, team management strategies, and initiatives to promote employees’ physical and mental health, will be discussed in the paper.', 'keywords': 'workplace healthy; long COVID-19; well-being; economy', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creationDate': \"D:20220916180113+08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20220916122645+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''})]"
